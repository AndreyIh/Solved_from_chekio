# "Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division. Let's learn computers.
# 
# You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
# "Fizz Buzz"if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
# "Fizz"if the number is divisible by 3;
# "Buzz"if the number is divisible by 5;
# The numberas a string for other cases.
# 
# 
# Input:A number as an integer.
# 
# Output:The answer as a string.
# 
# Precondition:0 < number â‰¤ 1000
