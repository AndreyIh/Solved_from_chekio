# Given a list of elements, create and return a list whose elements are lists that contain the consecutive runs of equal elements of the original list. Note that elements that arenâ€™t duplicated in the original list should become singleton lists in the result, so that every element gets included in the resulting list of lists.

# Input:List of str and int.
