# You are the modern man who prefers the 24-hour time format. But the 12-hour format is used in some places. Your task is to convert the time from the 12-h format into 24-h by following the next rules:
# - the output format should be 'hh:mm'
# - if the output hour is less than 10 - write '0' before it. For example: '09:05'
# Here you can find some useful information about the12-hour format.
# 
# 
# 
# Input:Time in a 12-hour format (as a string).
# 
# Output:Time in a 24-hour format (as a string).
# 
# Precondition:
# '00:00'<= time<= '23:59'
# 
# 
# END_DESC
